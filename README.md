This is an interface that was created as the final project for Android Application Development at South Hills School of Business and Technology in 2022.

The goal of the project was to create a database of movies with descriptions and images that can be accessed through an Android device.

The project was created using Android Studio with Java as the primary language and SQLite as the backing database.
